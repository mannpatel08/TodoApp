## 🧠 How It Works

### 🔸 Data Storage
- Tasks are stored in a local array
- Each task has a unique ID

### 🔸 Task Object Example
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Prepare Report",
  "description": "Complete weekly report",
  "priority": "High",
  "status": "Pending"
}
```

### 🔸 Backend Flow
- Express handles routing and server logic
- EJS renders dynamic UI pages
- Form data is processed using middleware
